<h3><strong>1. Set/Seal Your Lipstick With A Tissue And Powder.</strong></h3>
<p>To make the lipstick last for hours, apply it on and dab it with a tissue over your mouth, then use a layer of powder to keep the colour from fading or smearing. The powder can even alter your lip colour; the shield will protect it from brightening or dulling your lips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>2. Groom Your Eyebrows Using A Spoolie Or Mascara Brush.</strong></h3>
<p>Brush your brows with these spoolie brushes, aka these mascara wands. Prepping your brows with a spool can take up to 10 seconds, but it&rsquo;s an easy way to ensure your brows are in place before you use other beauty products. Spoolie brushes are very cheap and reusable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>3. Prep Your Lips With Exfoliation Before Applying Lipstick.</strong></h3>
<p>Try prepping your lips with a gentle lip scrub. The physical exfoliation will help remove the dry skin on top of your lips, leaving you with a smoother, softer base. For your products. Make sure to use it at most once a week. Applying too much can lead to the risk of irritation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>4. Warm Up Your Pencil Liner For Its Smooth Application.</strong></h3>
<p>Creamy makeup products blend better when warmed. So, if your eyeliner is smudged or pulled on your eyelids or used multiple layers for a decent look, mix it slightly before you start to line it. To do this, heat the tip of the liner under a light flame for a second or until it becomes sticky, let it cool a bit, and then observe the consistent change before your eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>5. Create A Cat-Eye Outline.</strong></h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble creating the winged eyeliner, try outlining the shape first and then filling it in. Extend a line through the lower lash line to make the lower part of the cat&rsquo;s eye first. Next, decide how thick you want your liner to be and draw a top rope from the end of the brow line to the upper lash line. Once you&rsquo;ve traced both sides and everything looks symmetrical, fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>6. Utilize A Spoon As A Stencil For Winged Eyeliner.</strong></h3>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t draw a freehand cat&rsquo;s eye, get a spoon and use it as a stencil. Apply the tip of the spoon to the outer corner of the eye, and use the liquid eyeliner to draw a straight line as the first step to apply the cat eye. Then flip the spoon over so it is your eyelids, and use the rounded outer edge to create the perfect curved wings effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>7. Smoky Eye Makeup Look With The Help Of A Hashtag</strong></h3>
<p>A smoky eye can go from glamorous to sloppy very quickly if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing. To keep it simple, use a liquid eyeliner to draw the diagonal hashtag symbol on the outer third of the eyelid, then blend in with a sponge or blending brush. Not only will this ensure that both eyes are symmetrical, but it will also help prevent you from overdoing your eyeliner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>8. Warm Your Eyelash Curler Tool Using A Hair Dryer.</strong></h3>
<p>Create your heated eyelash curler by blowing hot air over your eyelash curler. Applying heat will help your lashes curl up faster and stay in shape longer. Heat the curler with a hair dryer until it heats up, wait until it cools a bit but is still warm (test on the inside of your arm before application), then clamp down your lashes to provide them curls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>9. Make Sure You Use A Bobby Pin To Apply Eyelash Glue.</strong></h3>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t apply false lashes, try out this makeup tip. Use a clean bobby pin, carefully apply a few dots of glue with the help of the bobby pin&rsquo;s information to the lashes, and spread them evenly. Wait a few seconds or until the adhesive adheres, then apply the lashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>10. Prioritize Applying Foundation Before Concealer.</strong></h3>
<p>The easiest way to improve your makeup routine is to try applying foundation before your concealer. Start with a base that will help minimize any redness or discolouration, almost like creating a smooth base for the rest of your products. You can then use your concealer to treat any remaining breakouts or redness, and you&rsquo;ll use less product in the process. Foundation before concealer is a great solution to prevent cakey makeup and creases wrinkles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>11. Mixing Petroleum Jelly With The Lipstick</strong></h3>
<p>If you love eye shadow and want to use it as a lip colour, mix the liquid pigments with some Vaseline (Aquaphor or Vaseline is excellent) in a spoon and apply it on the lips. You can create your personalized lip colour according to your choice. This is the best makeup trick ever. The easiest and fastest method to identify your lip shade is to use a lip liner in the same shade as your lipstick and create an X to match your natural lip line. Next, apply lipstick on the bottom three parts of the X that you will make, and continue to apply lipstick as usual to complete your look.</p>

<h3><strong>12. Conceal Dark Circles With Triangular Shapes.</strong></h3>
<p>If you want to brighten your under-eye area, stop applying dotted concealer and try applying concealer in a triangle pattern. Draw the bottom of the triangle just below your lashes and the top towards your cheekbones. This helps to completely hide the redness and shadows to give the illusion of a lighter bottom.
